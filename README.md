# n1-rss
Python script which pushes N1 RSS to your Discord Server
You can create 3 .txt files:
sent_link.txt
monitor_log.txt
error_log.txt

This way, the script will monitor which links were sent, and will prevent sending same links multiple times.
Also there will be few pip requirements:
feedparser
requests
colorama
